After having the physical design in mind, we had to go for some fancy laser
cutting (definitely _had_ to, couldn't do it otherwise...)!

And that's how it looks like when you have Aravinth copy'n'pasting the official
#SHDB17 logo on your design before "print out" on #TUBerlin's laser cutter:

In the back you can see the laser cutter producing the first real cuts.
Awesome!
