In principle, we just want to build a light-proof case. 
The "L" form however would be nice to generate a 90° angle:

We designed the basics of the case on 
[http://www.makercase.com](http://www.makercase.com).

The design is getting ready here in real-time; check it on github:
[github.com/rgiessmann/DIY_fluorometer/design_case_box](github.com/rgiessmann/DIY_fluorometer/design_case_box)
.

The general idea is to make the case as modular as possible.

General dimensions of the case are going to be 150x150x50mm.

Later, we will prepare inserts into the case, to block away scatter light and 
to position the LEDs, filters, and detectors at variable distances.
